# Introduction

With an alarming 41.9% of the U.S. population classified as obese, as
revealed by the 2011 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) [1], the implications of this health crisis become undeniably
significant. However, the impact becomes even more pronounced when
considered globally, where obesity contributed to 8% of deaths in
2017---an alarming surge from 4.5% in 1990 [2].

Obesity, beyond its visual manifestations, is intricately linked to
severe health conditions, including heart disease, stroke, type 2
diabetes, and various cancers. These conditions stand as leading causes
of preventable, premature deaths. The economic burden is equally
staggering, with the estimated annual medical cost of obesity in the
United States reaching nearly \$173 billion in 2019 dollars. Notably,
medical costs for adults grappling with obesity were \$1,861 higher than
those for individuals maintaining a healthy weight [1].

As we delve into the complex web of factors contributing to obesity, the
role of food emerges as a central player. Continuous overconsumption, a
potential precursor to weight gain and obesity, emphasizes the critical
importance of understanding food composition. Certain foods, due to
their nutrient content, can significantly influence overall health
outcomes.

However, the narrative extends beyond food alone. Economic status
emerges as a pivotal consideration, acting as a covariate in my
analysis. Death rates attributed to obesity exhibit variations among
countries, and a fundamental differentiator lies in their economic
standing. Developed countries, buoyed by high incomes, may boast
advanced medical systems capable of mitigating obesity-related deaths.
Paradoxically, these countries may also grapple with higher obesity
prevalence. On the contrary, developing nations, constrained by lower
incomes, may face a different set of challenges, potentially emphasizing
malnutrition over obesity.

In this analysis, the focal point is discerning the effects of a
country's food supply and economic status on death rates attributed to
obesity. The implications of this study are far-reaching, offering
valuable insights for policymakers eager to curb obesity-related deaths
and aiding consumers in crafting diets resilient to the detrimental
effects of obesity.

A dual-stage methodology will be employed. Initially, simple linear
regression sheds light on the potential impact of individual food groups
and a country's economic status. This analysis guides us towards
identifying statistically significant associations. Subsequently, the
methodology advances to Lasso regression, a more sophisticated model
aimed at pinpointing the most influential variables while mitigating the
risk of overfitting.

# Data

## Data Sources

Three separate datasets, totaling 26 predictor variables and 1 response
variable, are used in this analysis:

1)  Daily caloric supply (OWID based on UN FAO & historical sources)

Predictor variables (after renaming): `Miscellaneous`, `Alcohol`,
`Animal.fat`, `Vegetable.oils`, `Oilcrops`, `Fish.and.seafood`,
`Sugar.crops`, `Sugar.sweeteners`, `Starchy.roots`, `Meat.other`,
`Meat.sheep.and.goat`, `Meat.pig`, `Meat.poultry`, `Meat.beef`, `Eggs`,
`Milk`, `Nuts`, `Fruit`, `Vegetables`, `Pulses`, `Cereals.other`,
`Barley`, `Maize`, `Rice`, `Wheat` - each one (25 total) is a food group
available for consumption, continuous, unit (kcal per day per capita)

processed by Our World in Data

2)  World Bank income classification

Predictor variable (after renaming): `Income.group` - nominal, four
categories (Low-income countries, Lower-middle-income countries,
Upper-middle-income countries, High-income countries)

Source: World Bank (2022) -- processed by Our World in Data

3)  Share of total deaths that are from all causes attributed to high
    body-mass index, in both sexes aged age-standardized

Response variable (after renaming): `Death.obesity` - continuous, unit
(%)

## Data Cleaning & Merging

```{r}
# Filter out 2019 data (newest for both data sets)
# Filter out entities without code (not countries)
supply <- supply |>
  filter(Code != "", Year == 2019) |>
  select(-Code, -Year)

death <- death |>
  filter(Code != "",Year == 2019) |>
  select(-Code, -Year)

# gdp <- gdp |>
#  filter(Code != "",Year == 2019) |>
#  select(-Code, -Year)

income.group <- income.group |>
  filter(Code != "",Year == 2019) |>
  select(-Code, -Year)

# Rename variables
colnames(supply) <- c("Country", "Miscellaneous", "Alcohol", "Animal.fat", "Vegetable.oils", "Oilcrops", "Fish.and.seafood", "Sugar.crops", "Sugar.sweeteners", "Starchy.roots", "Meat.other", "Meat.sheep.and.goat", "Meat.pig", "Meat.poultry", "Meat.beef", "Eggs", "Milk", "Nuts", "Fruit", "Vegetables", "Pulses", "Cereals.other", "Barley", "Maize", "Rice", "Wheat")

colnames(death) <- c("Country", "Death.obesity")

# colnames(gdp) <- c("Country", "GDP.per.capita")

colnames(income.group) <- c("Country", "Income.group")
```

```{r}
# Merge data sets
df <- merge(supply, income.group, by = "Country", all = FALSE)
# df <- merge(df, gdp, by = "Country", all = FALSE)
df <- merge(df, death, by = "Country", all = FALSE)
```

## Missing Data Imputation

```{r include = FALSE}
# Create a mice imputation object
mice_imputation <- mice(df, method = "pmm")

# Perform the imputation
df <- complete(mice_imputation)
```

In my analysis, I encountered missing values in certain food groups
across countries. Removing these entries would significantly reduce the
dataset entries, leaving only 100 out of 174 countries with 45 degrees
of freedom for model fitting (if all columns are utilized for the
model). This approach would not be ideal for accurately representing
global patterns or obtaining robust model estimates.

To address this challenge, I opted for imputation using the "predictive
mean matching"(PMM) method from the `mice` package. PMM ensures that
imputed values are drawn from observed values with similar predicted
values, preserving the distributional characteristics of the data. This
method allows us to utilize the full dataset, providing a more
comprehensive and representative view of the relationships between food
supply patterns and obesity death rates across diverse countries.
Imputing missing values with PMM contributes to the validity of our
inferences and enhances the generalizability of my findings to a broader
global context.

simple daily diet intake guideline: 30% grains, 40% vegetables, 10%
fruits, and 20% protein. [1] [2]

## Limitations

1)  supply, not consumption. assuming consumption is proportional to
    supply.
